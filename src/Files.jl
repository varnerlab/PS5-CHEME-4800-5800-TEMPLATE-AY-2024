    readedgesfile(filepath::String; comment::Char='#', 
        delim::Char=',') -> Dict{Int64,MyGraphEdgeModel}

The readedgesfile function reads a file with edge data and returns a dictionary of edges, 
where the key is the line number and the value is an instance of `MyGraphEdgeModel`.

### Arguments
- `filepath::String`: the path to the edge file that we need to read
- `comment::Char`: the character that indicates a comment line in the file
- `delim::Char`: the character that separates the fields in the file

### Returns
- a dictionary of edges, where the key is the line number and the value is an instance of `MyGraphEdgeModel`
